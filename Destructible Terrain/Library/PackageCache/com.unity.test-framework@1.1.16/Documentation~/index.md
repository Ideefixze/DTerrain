# About Unity Test Framework

The Unity Test Framework (UTF) enables Unity users to test their code in both **Edit Mode** and **Play Mode**, and also on target platforms such as [Standalone](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Standalone.html), Android, iOS, etc.

This package provides a standard test framework for users of Unity and developers at Unity so that both benefit from the same features and can write tests the same way. 

UTF uses a Unity integration of NUnit library, which is an open-source unit testing library for .Net languages. For more information about NUnit, see the [official NUnit website](http://www.nunit.org/) and the [NUnit documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/NUnit-Documentation).

> **Note**: UTF is not a new concept or toolset; it is an adjusted and more descriptive naming for the toolset otherwise known as Unity Test Runner, which is now available as this package.
