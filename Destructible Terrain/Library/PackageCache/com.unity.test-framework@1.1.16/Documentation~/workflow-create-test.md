# Workflow: How to create a test

To create a test, do the following:

1. Create your *Test* [assembly folder](./workflow-create-test-assembly.md) and select it in the **Project** window.
2. Click the button **Create Test Script in current folder** option in the **Test Runner** window.

3. It creates a *NewTestScript.cs* file in the *Tests* folder. Change the name of the script, if necessary, and press Enter to accept it. 

![NewTestScript.cs](./images/new-test-script.png)

Now youâ€™ll see two sample tests in the Test Runner window:

Now you can open the tests in your favorite script editor.

You can also create test scripts by navigating to **Assets** > **Create > Testing** > **C# Test Script**, unless adding a test script would result in a compilation error.

> **Note**: Unity does not include `TestAssemblies` ([NUnit](http://www.nunit.org/), Unity Test Framework, and user script assemblies) when using the normal build pipeline, but does include them when using **Run on &lt;Platform&gt;** in the Test Runner window.

## Filters

If you have a lot of tests, and you only want to view/run a sub-set of them, you can filter them in three ways (see image above): 

* Type in the search box in the top left

* Click a test class or fixture (such as **NewTestScript** in the image above)

* Click one of the test result icon buttons in the top right
