# Resetting clips

You can reset the duration and speed of a clip. Resetting a clip **does not reset** the following properties:

* Start
* Ease In Duration and Ease Out Duration
* Animation Extrapolation settings
* Blend Curves

To reset a clip, right-click the clip and select **Editing** from the context menu. Then, select **Reset Duration**, **Reset Speed**, or **Reset All**. Depending on the reset option you select, resetting a clip does the following:

|**Option:** |**Description:** |
|:---|:---|
|**Reset Duration**|Resets the Duration and the Clip In.|
|**Reset Speed**|Resets the Speed Multiplier.|
|**Reset All**|Resets the Duration, Clip In, and Speed Multiplier.|

If resetting a clip results in two clips overlapping each other, Timeline creates a blend for the overlap, regardless of the selected Clip Edit mode.
