# Editing keys

Edit a key to change its time, value, or both. The Curves view provides the following different methods for editing a key:

* Right-click a key and select **Edit** from the context menu to enter specific values for time and value.
* Select a key and press Enter to enter specific values.
* Select and drag a key to change its time and value.
* Drag a key vertically, then press Shift to snap the key on the vertical axis. This changes the value of the key, but not its time. 
* Drag a key horizontally, then press Shift to snap the key on the horizontal axis. This changes the time of the key, but not its value.
