_Unity's Timeline_

Use Unity's Timeline to create cinematic content, game-play sequences, audio sequences, and complex particle effects.

Each cut-scene, cinematic, or game-play sequence that you create with Unity's Timeline consists of a Timeline Asset and a Timeline instance. The [Timeline window](tl_window.md) creates and modifies Timeline Assets and Timeline instances simultaneously. 

The [Timeline Overview section](tl_about.md) includes details on the relationship between the Timeline window, Timeline Assets, and Timeline instances.

The [Using Timeline section](wf_about.md) shows how to create Timeline Assets and Timeline instances, record basic animation, animate humanoids, and use other Timeline features.
