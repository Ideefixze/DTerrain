# Deleting tracks

Delete a track to remove the track, its clips, blends, and properties from the Timeline window. This is a destructive action that modifies a Timeline Asset and affects all Timeline instances based on the Timeline Asset. 

There are many ways to delete tracks:

* Select a track and press the **Delete** key (or hold **Command** and press **Delete**).
* Select a track. Right-click an empty area in the Track list and select **Delete** from the context menu.
* Right-click a track and select **Delete** from the context menu.

Deleting an Animation track also deletes the recorded Infinite clips for Animation clips that were converted from Infinite clips. The Project window may still show recorded Infinite clips as children of a Timeline Asset because it is not updated until you save the Scene or Project. 

You cannot delete a locked track.
