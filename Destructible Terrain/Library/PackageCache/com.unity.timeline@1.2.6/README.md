# How to format your code for the repo

Clone https://github.cds.internal.unity3d.com/unity/git-hgmeta-format/tree/csharp-format (the branch is important):
```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch csharp-format git@github.cds.internal.unity3d.com:unity/git-hgmeta-format.git
```
go in your repo clone and run
```bash
perl <gitformat clone dir>/hooks/install-hooks.pl
```
If you have things already committed without the formatting, run
```bash
perl <gitformat clone dir>/format.pl branch
```
where `branch` is litteraly `branch` and not `$BRANCHNAME`
